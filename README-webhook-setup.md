# Vapi Webhook Setup Instructions

## Current Status
We've developed and tested webhook endpoints that work correctly in the local development environment, but are not accessible in the deployed Replit environment.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use a webhook relay service
Consider using a service like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) or [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) to:
1. Receive webhooks from Vapi
2. Process and forward them to your application's appropriate endpoints

### Option 2: Set up a dedicated webhook microservice
Deploy a simple standalone webhook service on a platform like:
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
- [Render](https://render.com)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io)

### Option 3: Implement polling instead of webhooks
If webhooks prove challenging, consider implementing a polling mechanism:
1. Periodically query the Vapi API for call updates
2. Process any new data since the last query

## Implementation Details

Here are the key events we need to handle from Vapi:
- `call.started`: When a new call begins
- `call.ended`: When a call completes
- `call.transcription`: When a transcription becomes available
- `call.summary`: When a call summary is generated

## Testing Locally
The following local endpoints have been verified to work correctly:
- `http://localhost:5000/hook` - Basic webhook endpoint
- `http://localhost:5000/raw-webhook` - Raw webhook with no JSON parsing
- `http://localhost:5000/vapi-webhook` - More detailed webhook with logging

## Next Steps
1. Choose one of the alternative solutions above
2. Set up the chosen solution
3. Configure Vapi to send webhooks to the new endpoint
4. Implement handlers to process the webhook data and update the database
